## Customizing your bot

### Name

Edit your site title and description in `src/App.tsx`

### Prompt

The prompt is set in `config.edge.ts`. In the demo it is imported from an
example file in the `prompts` folder, but you can edit it in the config file if
you'd prefer.

The important parts in this prompt are:

- who the bot is and what it should do.
- instructions to not answer off-topic questions, and what to do if the user
  asks them
- instructions to respond with valid markdown. This is optional, but it allows
  the bot to respond with formatted text.
- contextual information about the date and user location. These are optional
  but can help the bot to be more accurate.

### Design

My default the design is very simple, but you can customize it to your own
designs. The site is stule with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), so you can
use any of the Tailwind classes to style your bot. The main components are:

- `src/routes/index.tsx` - the main chat interface
- `src/components/Welcome.tsx` - the welcome screen
- `src/components/ChatMessage.tsx` - the chat message component

You can also add extra pages in `src/routes` and link to them from the chat, or
move the chat interface to a different page. The chat interface is an
[Impala](https://github.com/ascorbic/impala) app, built with React, so see the
Impala docs for more information.
